# My 100 Days of Code Challenge 💪 

Welcome to my coding journey!  I'm taking on the #100DaysOfCode challenge to level up my skills and tackle daily coding exercises.

## About this Repository 📚

This repository is a record of my progress throughout the challenge. Here's what you'll find:

- **LeetCode Solutions:** Focused on C programming language, I'll be primarily sharing solutions to LeetCode problems that I've solved.
- **Concise Code:** I'll prioritize the core code needed to solve the problems.  Expect minimal comments and explanations for now.
- **Open to Contributions:**  Want to add more detailed explanations, test cases, or even solutions in other languages? Feel free to fork this repository and submit your pull requests!  

## Structure 📂

- Each day's code will be organized in a separate folder named `day_XX` (e.g., `day_01`, `day_02`).
- File names will be intuitive and reflect the LeetCode problem name (e.g., `two_sum.c`).

## How to Contribute 🤝

I'm excited to collaborate and learn from the community! Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Fork the repository.**
2. **Create a branch** for your changes.
3. **Add or enhance code:**
   - Write comprehensive comments explaining the logic.
   - Include test cases to validate the solutions.
   - Translate solutions to other programming languages (Python, Java, etc.).
4. **Submit a pull request** for review.
